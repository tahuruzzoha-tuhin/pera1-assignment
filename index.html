            <h1> Freeze Your Fruit for a <span class="extra-color">Dessert Cocktail. </span>That’s Better Than Ice Cream.</h1>

            <p>I enjoy this dish more than ice cream, though: I love the bouncy texture of the coconut gel and palm fruit, and the chewiness of macapuno strings. The best part? It’s made using solely pantry ingredients—yes, dairy and all—and you really don’t need a recipe (or a measuring cup) to make it. Using exact quantities doesn’t really matter here—or, rather, you should adjust the quantities to your own preferences. Some people like it chunky and heavy on the fruit while others prefer it extra-creamy. </p>

            <h4>Recipe One</h4>
            <p>I and my friend had dinner here one of the nights we were in Kalpetta. The ambiance was good and the food recommendations were great. We had a traditional Arabian rice and chicken preparation, Kuzhi Manthi. It was our first experience having this dish, and although a bit dry, it tasted great. Would recommend this place that's easily noticed from a vehicle and has ample parking.</p>

            <h4>Recipe Two</h4>
            <p>We visited this place for breakfast and dinner. The place is very conveniently located (on the highway ) with ample parking space. The food at both the meals was tasty and definitely worth the price. Good quantity served per portion. Service as also good. Overall , a good place to have food (both south indian and north indian) when staying in Vythiri. Would recommend it definitely</p>
